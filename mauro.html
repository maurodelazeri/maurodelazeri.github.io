    Neuroplasticity:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections

<p dir="ltr">
    The nervous system allows organisms to sense, organize, and react to

    PNS consists of two main components: 1) the somatic nervous system and 2)
    the autonomic nervous system.
