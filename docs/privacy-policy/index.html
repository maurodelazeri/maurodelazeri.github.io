authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In
order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your
user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to
that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN
Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us
when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or
to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN
Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your
account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may
limit the Services we are able to provide you.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="6-use-of-personal-information"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#6-use-of-personal-information">#</a>6. Use of Personal Information</h3><hr/><p>Your Personal Information.
