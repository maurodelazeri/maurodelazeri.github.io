modify, use, comment on and / or republish, both on and off the Site and
Services, reasonable amounts of Shared Content posted by another Member
or by Zinnion for the following purposes consistent with our mission to
help people write, test and improve their algorithms: (1) your personal
use; (2) educational use at not-for-profit schools, colleges, and
universities; and (3) to the extent Zinnion has expressly authorized in
a separate written agreement, applicable to you, for internal business
or other purposes. If you do copy, modify, comment on or republish
Shared Content posted by another Member or Zinnion, you must (a)
attribute authorship of that Shared Content to such Member or Zinnion

accessed the Shared Content. All comments that you post to the Site
should be respectful of others and in all cases subject to the
restrictions and guidelines of good behavior outlined in this Section 3.
To be clear, the license to copy, modify and / or republish any Content

another Member or by Zinnion for the above-stated purposes and use. You
are not permitted, and are expressly prohibited from copying, modifying,
and republishing the Content of Zinnion and its other Members except as
expressly permitted above. Should a question arise in the future as to
what does or does not constitute Shared Content, or how it may be used,
you may contact us per the last bullet of Section 16 of this Agreement.

this issue and in any case Zinnion’s decision about Shared Content will

notice to you as provided in Section 19, if we suspect any violation of

No Liability for Shared Content or Third Party Content.</strong></h3><p>A portion of the Content contained on the Site or Services not in the

reasonable best efforts to keep your Content private. All Content that
you do not post, display, or otherwise make available in Common Areas or
share with any other selected Member(s) is treated as “Private Content,”
unless expressly noted otherwise; this includes your account
information, algorithms, datasets, and other Content that only you can
access. Zinnion will not review, share, or otherwise make use of Private
Content except as specifically provided in our Privacy Policy or this
Agreement. With respect to this Agreement, Zinnion may access,
reproduce, store, delete, review, share, or otherwise make use of
Private Content in the following circumstances (including in source code
or similar form):</p><ul><li>If necessary in the course of providing technical support or other
maintenance of the Site or Services; provided that, wherever
possible, any access by Zinnion for technical support or maintenance
purposes will be restricted to the very specific technical purpose
relevant to such support or maintenance;</li><li>In order to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory
requirements or order of any court order or governmental authority;</li><li>In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content
may present a security risk;</li><li>In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content
may constitute a violation of the Terms of Use, including an
infringement or misappropriation of any third party right or other
unauthorized use of Third Party Content; or</li><li>In the event that we consider, in our discretion, that such Content
may be relevant to Zinnion’s defense in any legal proceeding.</li></ul><p>Additionally, in accordance with Zinnion&#x27;s efforts to support the
creation of high-quality strategies in which to invest, we may review
the results of your backtests and the performance and other &quot;data
exhaust&quot; of your Content. Such performance information includes, but is
not restricted to, returns and risk measurements of any backtest
executed with the Content. We may generate additional performance data
from your Content for the purposes of (a) verifying that software
platform changes do not change or break your algorithm or (b) analyzing
standardized performance results. You further agree that Zinnion may
reproduce, store, and create derivative works from your Private Content
or other Content necessary to evaluate your algorithm. Any testing,
evaluation, reproduction or other use will be done with the spirit and
intent of protecting your Content. We may also share anonymized and/or
aggregated algorithm performance statistics with third parties. Any such
external or third party usage of performance data will not be authorized
to the extent such usage of performance data would reveal the details
and workings of the underlying Content.</p><p>With regard to your Private Content, you grant Zinnion a worldwide,
sublicensable, assignable, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual,
irrevocable license to use your Private Content as described in this
Agreement, including as discussed in this section. Further, with respect
to your Private Content, you represent that: (i) you have the necessary
rights to grant Zinnion the license to use your Private Content as
described in this Agreement; and (ii) the Private Content does not
violate any of Zinnion’s Terms of Use. The limited license you grant to
Zinnion regarding use of your Private Content continues even if you stop
using the Site and Services.</p><p>To the extent you choose to post, display or otherwise make your Content
available to any selected Member(s), but do not otherwise make such

applicable to your Private Content as well as any other uses (such as
reproduction, display, and transmission) necessary to facilitate sharing

collaborate. Further, you represent that: (i) you have the necessary
rights to grant Zinnion the license to use your Collaborative Content as
described in this Agreement; and (ii) the Collaborative Content does not

use of your Collaborative Content as you may permit; and (ii) such
access and use does not violate any of Zinnion’s Terms of Use. Other
business or legal terms relevant to your collaboration, such as scope of
use, licensing, ownership, or other relevant rights and obligations with
respect to your Collaborative Content and derivatives, if any, are to be
addressed between you and the Member(s) with whom you choose to

Zinnion from any liability related to: (a) any incorrect or inaccurate
Content posted on the Services, whether caused by any user of the

omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or

unauthorized access to, or alteration of, user or Member communications.
If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code
Section 1542, which states: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims
which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have
materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot;</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="16-copyright-violations"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#16-copyright-violations">#</a><strong>16.

<strong>17. Jurisdictional Issues.</strong></p><p>Zinnion makes no representation or warranty that the Content and
information on the Site and/or the Services are appropriate or available
or appropriate for use in locations outside the United States. Those who
choose to access the Site or use the Services from other locations do so
on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for
compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Zinnion
reserves the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to limit the
availability and accessibility of the Site and/or the Services to any
person, geographic area, or jurisdiction it so desires, and to limit the
quantities of any such Service or products that it provides.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="18-arbitration-agreement-and-jury-trial-waiver-class-action-waiver-and-forum-selection-clause"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#18-arbitration-agreement-and-jury-trial-waiver-class-action-waiver-and-forum-selection-clause">#</a><strong>18. Arbitration Agreement And Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection Clause.</strong></h3><p>All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of
action between you and Zinnion arising out of, under, or related to
these Terms of Use or our privacy practices (including any action we
take or authorize with respect to information about or provided by you)
shall be settled exclusively through binding arbitration.</p><p>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any
state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one
commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”). As modified by these Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by
the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s
Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them
applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
(collectively “Rules and Procedures”).</p><p>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend
your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to
small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL
ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING,
BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES
APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any
court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p><p>You and Zinnion must abide by the following rules: (i) for any claim
that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration
shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the
arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing; (ii) if the claim
exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration
shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic
hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is
appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by
you and Zinnion, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the
hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings
which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of
their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; (iii) the
arbitrator’s ruling is binding and not merely advisory; (iv) ANY CLAIMS
BROUGHT BY YOU OR ZINNION MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (v) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY
FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING; (vi) in the event that you
are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Zinnion will pay as much
of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as
the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (vii) Zinnion
also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume
responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (viii) the
arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at
law; (ix) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact
and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Zinnion shall be
confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any
administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of
them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any
other person/Zinnion customer; and (x) each side pays its own attorneys’
fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires
the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Zinnion may bring an
individual action in small claims court. In addition, if you are a
Member outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in
our Privacy Statement (if any), and not this arbitration provision,
shall apply to any disputes related to privacy. Further, claims of
defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright,
trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration
provision. Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts
do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located
in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration
provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such
courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator’s
ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such
courts. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of
the right to arbitrate.</p><p>With the exception of subparts (iv) and (v) in the paragraph above
(prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of
this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the
balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall
be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained
herein. If, however, either subpart (c) or (d) is found to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration
provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Zinnion shall be
entitled to arbitration. In the event this arbitration provision is held
unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the
dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes
of action between you and Zinnion shall be exclusively brought in the
state or federal courts specified in subsection “(d)” above.</p><p>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file
an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA

Termination.</strong></h3><p>This Agreement shall remain effective until terminated in accordance
with its own terms and conditions. You agree that Zinnion, in its sole
discretion, may terminate your password, account (in whole or in part),
or use of the Site or Services, and remove and discard any Content
within the Sites, at any time and for any reason. You agree that any
actions taken under this Section may be effective without prior notice
to you. YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE OR SERVICES OR DELETION
OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR YOUR UPLOADED CONTENT. In the event of termination,
however, those Sections in this Agreement which, by their nature,
survive termination of the Agreement shall so survive. Specifically, and
without limitation, the licenses you have granted to Zinnion and to
third parties to use any Content, Shared, Collaborative, and/or Private,
submitted by you or through your account, survives the termination of
this Agreement. Your license, as described in this Agreement, to use any
Content and/or Shared Content owned by Zinnion does not survive the
termination of this Agreement.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="20-general-information"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#20-general-information">#</a><strong>20. General Information.</strong></h3><p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
between you and Zinnion and governs your use of the Site and the
Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Zinnion. This
Agreement and the relationship between you and Zinnion shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The failure of Zinnion
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision
shall be deemed severed herefrom and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions. The section titles in this
Agreement are for convenience purposes only and have no legal or
contractual effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or
sub-licensable by you. However, we may assign this Agreement to any
third party whom we choose without your consent and/or without notice to
you. No waiver by Zinnion of any breach or default hereunder shall be
deemed a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. You
acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if
necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="21-electronic-communications"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#21-electronic-communications">#</a><strong>21. Electronic Communications.</strong></h3><p>You acknowledge and understand that (a) we can only give you the
benefits of accessing the Site and using the Services by conducting
business through the Internet, and therefore we need you to consent to
our giving you Communications (defined below) electronically, and (b)
this Section 21 informs you of your rights when receiving Communications
from us electronically. For contractual purposes, you: (i) consent to
receive communications from us in an electronic form and (ii) agree that
all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, documents, disclosures,
and other communications (“Communications”) that we provide to you
electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such Communications
would satisfy if they were in writing. Your consent to receive
Communications and do business electronically, and our agreement to do
so, applies to all of your interactions and transactions with us. The
foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights. You may also receive
a copy of this Agreement. You may withdraw your consent to receive
Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described
below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must
stop using the Site and Services. The withdrawal of your consent will
not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or
any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us
prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of
any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to
receive all Communications without interruption.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="22-modification-to-services"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#22-modification-to-services">#</a><strong>22. Modification to Services.</strong></h3><p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Site and any or all of
the Services, including the Content and Shared Content owned by Zinnion,
with or without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third
party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Site
and/or any or all of the Services. If you object to any such changes,
your sole recourse will be to cease access to the Site and/or Services,
as applicable. Continued access to the Site and/or Services, as
applicable, following notice of any such changes will indicate your
acknowledgment of such changes; agreement to amended license terms, as
applicable; and satisfaction with the Site and/or Services, as
applicable, as so modified.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="23-amendments-and-modifications-of-this-agreement"></a><a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#23-amendments-and-modifications-of-this-agreement">#</a><strong>23.

time. If any such amendment or modification is material, we will post
notice of it on the Site’s home page, community forum, and/or by email
to Members. Your access to the Site and use of the Services following
